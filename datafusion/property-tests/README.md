# Apache DataFusion Property Tests

[Apache DataFusion] is an extensible query execution framework, written in
Rust, that uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format.

This crate checks that implementations of DataFusion's extension points are
consistent with the contracts of those extension points. DataFusion trusts
what an implementation reports about itself, so an implementation that
reports something false can lead to wrong results or missed optimizations.
The checks run against the implementations defined in DataFusion and can be
used to test your own.

The crate currently covers `ExecutionPlan`, in the `physical_plan` module.

## ExecutionPlan

Optimizer rules trust what a plan reports about itself, such as its
cardinality effect, statistics and whether it supports limit pushdown. The
checks compare these with each other and with what the plan's inputs report.

Describe how to build your plan from its inputs, and let the harness do the
rest:

```rust
use datafusion_property_tests::physical_plan::fixtures::SourceSpec;
use datafusion_property_tests::physical_plan::harness::{PlanFactory, PlanHarness};

// One base spec per input: its schema, value distribution and size
let factory = PlanFactory::new("MyExec", vec![SourceSpec::new(schema)], |inputs| {
    let input = Arc::clone(&inputs[0]);
    // Bind expressions to the input's schema by name: the harness adds a
    // `__row_id` column to every input
    let key = col("a", &input.schema())?;
    Ok(Arc::new(MyExec::try_new(key, input)?) as Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>)
});

let report = PlanHarness::new().check(&factory)?;
report.assert_no_invariant_violations();
```

The harness generates the inputs, sorts, hash partitions or merges them into
one partition as the plan requires, and checks the plan on several cases:
several partitions with an empty one, a single partition, inexact and absent
statistics, empty input, constant columns, columns with an equal copy,
input sorted by its row ids, and hash partitioned input. The report lists
every case, with the plan and the findings of each case that has any.

To check a plan built by hand, use `PlanChecker` on inputs generated with
`SourceSpec`:

```rust
use datafusion_property_tests::physical_plan::PlanChecker;
use datafusion_property_tests::physical_plan::fixtures::SourceSpec;

// Generate an input with known data, statistics, ordering and partitioning
let input = SourceSpec::new(schema)
    .with_partition_rows(&[100, 0, 250])
    .build_arc()?;
let plan = build_my_plan(input)?;

let report = PlanChecker::new().check(&plan)?;
report.assert_no_invariant_violations();
```

- [CHECKS.md](docs/physical_plan/CHECKS.md) lists every check, why it
  matters and how to fix a violation.
- [DESIGN.md](docs/physical_plan/DESIGN.md) describes how the module is
  structured, including the harness.

To add a check, write a function that returns the findings for one node in
`src/physical_plan/checks/`, add it to `checks::all_checks` with its name,
and describe it in [CHECKS.md](docs/physical_plan/CHECKS.md).
