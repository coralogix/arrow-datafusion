# Apache DataFusion ExecutionPlan Checks

[Apache DataFusion] is an extensible query execution framework, written in
Rust, that uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format.

This crate checks that `ExecutionPlan` implementations are consistent with the
`ExecutionPlan` contract. Optimizer rules trust what a plan reports about
itself, such as its cardinality effect, statistics and orderings, so a plan
that reports something false can lead to wrong results or missed
optimizations. The checks run against the plans defined in DataFusion and can
be used to test your own plans.

Describe how to build your plan from its inputs, and let the harness do the
rest:

```rust
use datafusion_physical_plan_checks::fixtures::SourceSpec;
use datafusion_physical_plan_checks::harness::{PlanFactory, PlanHarness};

// One base spec per input: its schema, value distribution and size
let factory = PlanFactory::new("MyExec", vec![SourceSpec::new(schema)], |inputs| {
    let input = Arc::clone(&inputs[0]);
    // Bind expressions to the input's schema by name: the harness adds a
    // `__row_id` column to every input
    let key = col("a", &input.schema())?;
    Ok(Arc::new(MyExec::try_new(key, input)?) as Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>)
});

let report = PlanHarness::new().check(&factory)?;
report.assert_no_invariant_violations();
```

The harness generates the inputs, sorts, hash partitions or merges them into
one partition as the plan requires, and checks the plan on several cases:
several partitions with an empty one, a single partition, inexact and absent
statistics, and empty input. The report lists every case, with the plan and
the findings of each case that has any.

To check a plan built by hand, use `PlanChecker` on inputs generated with
`SourceSpec`:

```rust
use datafusion_physical_plan_checks::PlanChecker;
use datafusion_physical_plan_checks::fixtures::SourceSpec;

// Generate an input with known data, statistics, ordering and partitioning
let input = SourceSpec::new(schema)
    .with_partition_rows(&[100, 0, 250])
    .build_arc()?;
let plan = build_my_plan(input)?;

let report = PlanChecker::new().check(&plan)?;
report.assert_no_invariant_violations();
```

- [CHECKS.md](CHECKS.md) lists every check, why it matters and how to fix a
  violation.
- [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) tracks which checks are
  implemented, and the violations currently found in DataFusion's own plans.
- [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) describes how the crate is structured, including the
  harness, and where it is heading.

To add a check, write a function that returns the findings for one node, in
the file of `src/checks/` for the check's `CheckKind`, add it to
`checks::all_checks` with its name and `CheckKind`, and describe it in
[CHECKS.md](CHECKS.md).
