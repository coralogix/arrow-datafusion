//! Property checks for [`ExecutionPlan`] implementations.
//!
//! [`ExecutionPlan`] has many methods that describe a plan rather than run it,
//! such as [`ExecutionPlan::cardinality_effect`],
//! [`ExecutionPlan::maintains_input_order`] and the statistics it reports.
//! Optimizer rules trust these descriptions, so an implementation that gets one
//! wrong can make DataFusion return wrong results or miss optimizations. This
//! crate checks that the descriptions are consistent with each other and with
//! what the plan does when it runs.
//!
//! The easiest way to test a plan is to describe how to build it from its
//! inputs with a [`harness::PlanFactory`], and check it with a
//! [`harness::PlanHarness`]. The harness generates the inputs, meets the
//! plan's input requirements, and runs every check on several cases.
//!
//! Use [`PlanChecker`] to run every built-in check against every node of a
//! plan built by hand. Build the plan under test on inputs generated with
//! [`fixtures::SourceSpec`], which produces a [`fixtures::MockSourceExec`]
//! whose data, statistics, partitioning and ordering are known to be
//! consistent.
//!
//! A [`PlanCheck`] reads what the checker gathered for its [`CheckKind`]:
//! nothing but the node itself, the output of executing each node, the
//! outputs of [`Variant`]s of each node (rewritten copies, such as the plan
//! returned by `with_fetch`, or copies run under other settings, such as
//! another batch size), or the results of stream [`Experiment`]s (runs on
//! inputs that stall, fail or never end, observing how the node drives its
//! input streams). The [`oracle`] module computes the true properties of a
//! set of batches.
//!
//! See `CHECKS.md` in this crate for the catalog of checks, why each one
//! matters and how to fix a violation, and `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for which
//! checks are implemented.
//!
//! [`ExecutionPlan`]: datafusion_physical_plan::ExecutionPlan
//! [`ExecutionPlan::cardinality_effect`]: datafusion_physical_plan::ExecutionPlan::cardinality_effect
//! [`ExecutionPlan::maintains_input_order`]: datafusion_physical_plan::ExecutionPlan::maintains_input_order
