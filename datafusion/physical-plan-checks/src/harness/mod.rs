//! Testing a plan from a description of how to build it.
//!
//! A [`PlanFactory`] says how to build the plan under test from its inputs.
//! For each [`Profile`], the [`PlanHarness`] generates the inputs as the
//! profile lays them out, builds the plan, and reads what each node directly
//! above an input requires of it (`required_input_ordering` and
//! `input_distribution_requirements`). It then changes the inputs to meet the
//! requirements: an input that must be sorted is sorted, one that must be hash
//! partitioned is hash partitioned into the profile's number of partitions
//! (the same number for every input), and one that must be a single partition
//! gets one. A plan's requirements can depend on its inputs, so the harness
//! builds the plan again and repeats until the requirements are met. The
//! result is a [`Case`], and the harness runs a [`PlanChecker`] on the plan of
//! every case.

/// Describes a plan under test by how to build it from its inputs.
///
/// A factory has a name, one base [`SourceSpec`] per input, and a function
/// that builds the plan from input plans. The [`PlanHarness`] generates the
/// inputs for each case from the base specs, calls the function, and checks
/// the plan it returns.
///
/// # The base specs
///
/// A base spec carries what only the author of the plan knows: the schema,
/// the value distribution (for example few distinct values on join keys, so
/// that the inputs of a join match), the number of rows, and optionally an
/// ordering the plan should see, for example to exercise a sorted code path.
/// The harness sets everything else for each case, replacing what the base
/// spec says: the partition layout, hash partitioning, the batch layout, the
/// statistics precision, the seed and the row ids (see [`Profile`]). It keeps
/// the base ordering unless the plan requires another one.
///
/// # The function
///
/// `create` is called several times per case: to probe the plan's input
/// requirements, and once more when they are met. It must be a pure function
/// of its inputs, and must use the input plans it receives as they are (not
/// copies), since the harness recognizes them by identity.
///
/// **Bind expressions to the schemas of the inputs it receives, by name**,
/// for example `col("a", &inputs[0].schema())`, never by a hard-coded column
/// index or a schema captured outside `create`. The harness appends a row id
/// column ([`ROW_ID_COLUMN`]) to every input, so the input schemas have more
/// columns than the base specs.
///

/// # use arrow::datatypes::{DataType, Field, Schema};
