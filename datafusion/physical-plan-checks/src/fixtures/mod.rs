//! Inputs for the plans under test.
//!
//! [`MockSourceExec`] is a leaf plan that serves fixed batches and reports
//! properties (statistics, ordering, partitioning) that are verified against
//! those batches. Checks treat what it reports as the truth. Its
//! [`StreamBehavior`] controls what its streams do after serving their
//! batches: end, stall, fail or never end.
//!
//! [`SourceSpec`] describes a source to generate: its schema, how its rows are
//! split into partitions and batches, the value distribution, and the
//! properties the data must satisfy. It is a plain value, so tests and the
//! [`harness`] can derive many variations of an input from one spec.
//!
//! [`harness`]: crate::harness
